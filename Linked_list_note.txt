#What is linked list 

	is a linear data structure, in which the element are not stored at contiguos memory
location, each linked list consist of Node where each Node contain a data field and
a link point to another Node in the list


Linked-list vs Array:
	Linked-list: (Singly)
	Pros:
		+ Dynamic Size
		+ Ease of Insertion/Deletion
	Cons:
		- Search take more time 
		-	Need to store pointer memory 
		- Random Access is not allowed 
	Array:
	Pros:
		+ Index is pretty much the best thing you can imagine 
		+	Accessing an element in Array is super fast  
	Cons:
		- 
		- 



In Array memory is assgined during compile time
while In linked-list it is allocated during execution of runtime
